# DESCRIPTION 💬:
After completing a Youtube course about the Introduction to Api's I took it upon myself to put to into practice what I had covered. This was a fairly simple application but I covered new areas of JavaScript such as the fetch function. In addition to this, I was also exposed to working with JSON data and extracting the desirable parts required to enable my application to function as desired.
